This project is a Django REST Framework–based backend system designed to support development finance operations similar to those handled by the Business Development Fund / Development Banks.

The system offers a centralized API for managing clients, development projects, loans, disbursements, and reporting, with a strong focus on scalability, security, and production readiness.
